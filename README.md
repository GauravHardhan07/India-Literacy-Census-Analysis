# India-Literacy-Census-Analysis
This Excel Dashboard analyzes literacy trends across Indian states using census data. It highlights regional gaps, identifies top-performing states, and provides insights for targeted education planning and social development strategies.

# Project Objective
To analyze literacy distribution across Indian states and UTs using population and literate counts, enabling regional comparison, data-driven education planning, and strategic social development insights.


# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Total Population 
| 📖 Total Literates
| 📈 National Literacy Rate
| 🧠 Highest Literacy State 
| 🚨 Lowest Literacy State 
| 🏁 Literacy Above 85% Count 
| 🗺️ Regional Comparison 

# Project Insights
- Kerala and Mizoram rank among the highest literate regions, above 90%+
- Bihar and Rajasthan fall below the national literacy average (~74.7%), indicating need for policy focus
- Southern and northeastern states outperform in literacy compared to central/northern counterparts
- UTs like Goa, Chandigarh, Lakshadweep exhibit high literacy despite smaller populations — potential models for others
- There is a strong inverse correlation between population size and literacy rate in some large states (e.g. UP)

# Conclusion
This literacy data analysis surfaces key regional disparities in educational attainment across India. It highlights the success of certain states/UTs and the urgent need to uplift literacy in underperforming regions. The findings can inform government programs, NGO interventions, and public awareness campaigns targeting low-literacy zones.
